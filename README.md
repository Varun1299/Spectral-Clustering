# Spectral Clustering

A small demo showing the difference betwwen Spectral clustering and K-means clustering. 

To view the demo go to : [https://varungohil.github.io/Spectral-Clustering/demo.html](https://varungohil.github.io/Spectral-Clustering/demo.html).
Click on _Show Widgets_ button. Wait for a 1-2 minutes for the widgets to initialize.

Once the widgets are initialized you can vary multiple parameters like number of clusters, data distribution, number of samples etc and compare the clusters returned by Spectral clutering and K-means clustering. A good example showing the difference between the 2 clustering algorithms can be seen by setting number of clusters to 2 and data type to Moon.
